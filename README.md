## Making Bash scripting, a Fun adventure!

**Sh:erpa** brings Cargo, OhMy and WebDev worflow to Bash scripting, using the Terminal as a browser!

_Because WebDevs should be able to do more than `npm run dev` in a terminal, and Bash lovers don't have to be reduced to `automations` writers, obviously because I like both sides._

### Quick install

Be sure to have Bash, curl, gawk instaled, then run the installer:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -sLo- https://sherpa-cli.netlify.app/install.sh)"
```

It will do the following:

- A. Install the CLI tools if not already installed.
- B. Clone the Sh:erpa repo as ~/.sherpa
- C. Add to the $PATH ~/.sherpa/bin
- D. Initiate the SherpaCustomDir as ~/sherpa

Use a Linux Distribution, still a Linux Distro but from WSL2 or MacOS.
See [the docs](https://sherpa-cli.netlify.app/getting-started/installation/prerequisites) for more details.

### The BashBox Anatomy

Upon `sherpa new myScript` the following is generated:

```bash
# /home/user/sherpa/boxes/myScript
.
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ file.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ docs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ myScript.md
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Sherpa.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bin.sh
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _globals.sh
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _header.sh
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _lib.sh
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _options.sh
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __paths.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ target
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ local
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ myScript
â””â”€â”€ tests
    â””â”€â”€ example_test.sh
```

A simple `src/bin.sh` file could look like that:

```bash
use "std/fmt"

main() {
  # Data
  dude="$(dataGet "hiker" "name")"

  # Template
  h1 "Greetings adventurer :)"
  hr "+" "-" # ------+------
  br
  p  "Welcome ${txtBlue} ${dude} ${x}!"
}

# Load the main fn if no arguments
[[ "$#" == 0 ]] && main; exit 0
```

Sh:erpa will merge the partials plus those sourced with `use "dir/file"`, generte docs, remove comments and blanks, then build the script and make it available for direct invocations. The tool can be picked-up by WebDevs discovering Bash or experienced shell scripters taking advantage of the build, watch and modularity while writing things their own way.

Since relative paths are used, some commands need to be used from a package root directoy: build, watch, run, test, doc, compile, edit.

### Aliases

Upon first install, some aliases are created via Aliasman. They can be visualised and eventually changed via `sherpa aliases` command, wich is just a shortcut for `aliasman -e` and opens the file storing them (with the default editor, like vim).

| **alias** | **replace**           | **effect**                      |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| s         | sherpa                | Shorter `s` commands            |
| sdd       | cd $HOME/.sherpa      | Jump into the Sherpa Dot Dir    |
| scd       | cd $HOME/sherpa       | Jump into the Sherpa Custom Dir |
| boxes     | cd $HOME/sherpa/boxes | Jump into the local Boxes Dir   |

After having created a BashBox with `s new <myScript>`, you can:

- Jump into the directory: `boxes && cd myScript`
- Open the main file: `s e bin`
- or any other command you need from the Root.

### Credits

Special shoutout to every person who has contributed code and genius ideas to the computing world since the first second of the Unix timestamp, making todays coding possible. Plus...

- Rust Cargo: For the perfect package management workflow.
- OhMyBash/ZSH: For the core/custom architecture inspiration.
- Webinstall.dev: For making the install possible via the awesome webi tool.
- Integrated projects: BashUnit, shdoc, bashdoc, SHC, Pathman, Aliasman, WatchExec, ...
- The non-dev people around me, enduring my talks about CLI, WebDev & how interesting Sh:erpa can be. They all hope that the Discord will be active enough so I could spare them.
