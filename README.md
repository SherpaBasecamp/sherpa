## Making bash scripting, a Fun adventure!

You sometimes can't chose between two nice things, and decide you should try to have them both working together.

Docs: [sherpa-cli.netlify.app](https://sherpa-cli.netlify.app) 
Discord: [Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/66bQJ6cuXG)

### Motivations

Because WebDevs should be able to do more than `npm run dev` in a terminal, and Bash lovers don't have to be reduced to `automations` writers, and obviously because I like both sides ...Sh:erpa is bringing RustCargo, OhMyBash or WebDev worflow to Bash, using the Terminal as just another browser.

In short? Beynnd conventions, searching new usages and ways to have fun together. Curious about what you will come up with, using Sh:erpa tools.

### Features

- Rust Cargo's way to create new packages
- Modular architecture with partials and build step
- OhMyBash type setup around core and custom directories
- Some Pug-like semantic markup because why not
- Integrated UnitTests suite for robust code
- Docs generation from comments during postProcessing
- Friendly way to source libraries (local or remote in CDN style)
- A non-verbose way to fetch JSON API's and use data in Bash
- Files based persistency with CRUD operation on yaml & json
- All of this eventually compiling to a binary
- With the possibility to share with the community and combine projects/tools made by others, via install - update - uninstall commands.
- ...just to name a few, already here.

### Credits

Special shoutout to every person who has contributed code and genius ideas to the computing world since the first second of the Unix timestamp, making todays coding possible. Plus...

- Rust Cargo: For the perfect package management workflow.
- OhMyBash/ZSH: For the core/custom architecture inspiration.
- Webinstall.dev: For making the install possible via the awesome webi tool.
- Integrated projects: BashUnit, shdoc, bashdoc, SHC, Pathman, Aliasman, WatchExec, ...
- The non-dev people around me, enduring my talks about CLI, WebDev & how interesting Sh:erpa can be. They all hope that the Discord will be active enough so I could spare them.
